                        Sri Sarada Devi, known to millions as Sri Sri Maa or Holy Mother, is the spiritual consort of Sri Ramakrishna. Born on 22 December 1854 in the village of Jayrambati, she was married to Sri Ramakrishna, according to the custom prevalent in India in those days, at the age of six. At the age of eighteen she went to Dakshineswar. Sri Ramakrishna worshiped her as the Divine Mother and taught her how to discharge the duties of life and at the same time lead an intensely spiritual life.

                        After the Master’s passing away, she played a significant role as the spiritual teacher and universal Mother in the development of the Ramakrishna Movement. By her life of sacrifice, forbearance, service and motherly love, which knew no distinctions of caste, creed, race or wealth, she has set a shining ideal for women all over the world.

            Some teachings of Sri Sarada Devi:
        </div>
        <div class="body-text">
            <ul>
                <li>“If you want peace, my child, see nobody’s faults. See your own faults. Learn to make the world your own. No one is a stranger, my child. The world is yours.”
                </li>
                <li>“One suffers as a result of one’s own actions. So, instead of blaming others for such sufferings, one should pray to the Lord and depending entirely on His grace, try to bear them patiently and with forbearance under all circumstances.”
                </li>
                <li>“You see, my son, it is a fact that you will face dangers. Difficulties always come, but they do not last forever. You will see that they pass away like water under a bridge.”
                </li>
                <li>“Pray to God with tears in your eyes whenever you want illumination or find yourself faced with any doubt or difficulty. The Lord will remove all your impurities, assuage your mental anguish and give you enlightenment.”
                </li>
                <li>“Always do your duty to others, but love you must give to God alone. Worldly love always brings in its wake untold misery.”
                </li>
                <li>On Love and Compassion: “Let me tell you how to love all equally. Do not demand anything of those you love. If you make demands, some will give you more and some less. In that case, you will love more those who give you more and less those who give you less. Thus your love will not be the same for all. You will not be able to love all impartially.”
                </li>
                <li>“Whenever you go from one place to another, observe the things around you, and also keep yourself well informed about what happens in the place you live. But keep your lips shut.”
                </li>
                <li>On the necessity of work: “It is essential that one should work. It is through work alone that one may break asunder the bonds of Karma; only then is one free of desires. One shouldn’t be without work even for a single moment.”
                </li>
